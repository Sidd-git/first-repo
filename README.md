Hi All,
Github is a really useful way of sharing knowledge in a global way. I have been using tools like perforce where the
brancing and operations were all command line. Github has a very good interactive UI that makes me quickly dive into 
the topic and check for the respective branches.
Thanks,
Siddarth
